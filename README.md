## Overview

**Credit Card Complaints Dashboard** is an interactive Tableau project built using a **synthetic dataset** representing **consumer credit card complaints across the United States**. The goal of this dashboard is to explore trends in complaint volume, response timeliness, issue categories, and submission channels, providing insights into consumer dissatisfaction patterns over time.

The dataset captures multiple attributes such as complaint issues, state-wise distribution, method of submission, and company response typesâ€”enabling a multi-dimensional understanding of financial service performance and consumer experience.
